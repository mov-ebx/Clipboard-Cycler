Keep in mind, this program only works in Windows.

## :thinking: What is this program?

The basic explanation, is its a text clipboard program, but whenever you paste with Ctrl+V, it copies the next item in the list.

So lets say I have a list with each letter of the alphabet, whenever I press Ctrl+V or hold it, it pastes the next letter.
